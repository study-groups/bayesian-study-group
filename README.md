A collection of Bayesian inspired concepts.

- [Wikipedia on Bayesian Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics): Bayesian statistics is a theory in the field of statistics based on the Bayesian interpretation of probability where probability expresses a degree of belief in an event.This differs from a number of other interpretations of probability, such as the frequentist interpretation that views probability as the limit of the relative frequency of an event after a large number of trials.

- [A Student's Guide to Bayesian Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJRxp3blEvZ8AKMXOy0fc0cqT61GsKCG): by  [Ben Lambert](https://ben-lambert.com/bayesian/). This course aims to provide a core understanding of Bayesian statistics  that is grounded in mathematical theory, yet friendly to the less mathematically-minded of persons. It aims to focus on the intuitive results of Bayesian theory rather than dwell on the mathematical minutiae.

- [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/): by Richard McElreath. The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.

- [Learning Bayesian Statistics Podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/show/learning-bayesian-statistics): A very well produced podcast interviewing big thinkers in Bayesian statistics by Alexandre Andorra.

- [Statistical Thinking](https://www.fharrell.com/):  Frank Harrell is a Professor of Biostatistics in the School of Medicine at Vanderbilt University. This blog is devoted to statistical thinking and its impact on science and everyday life.
